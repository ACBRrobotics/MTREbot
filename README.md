# MTREbot
A simple collection of ROS packages that include a full model of the MTREbot mobile robot platform and manipulator.  This repository also includes the information needed to construct and control a physical version of the platform as well.  This project was developed through research conducted in the Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering program at Kennesaw State University.

While a number of commercial ROS-based robotics platforms exist, they are often prohibitively expensive and don't offer students an in-depth view into everything it takes to develop your own robotics platform.  The goal of this project was to develop an open-source robotics platform that is not only highly capable but also affordable.  This robotics platform was designed to not only be useful but also to offer students the opportunity to learn everything they need to build their own custom ROS-based robotics platforms.
